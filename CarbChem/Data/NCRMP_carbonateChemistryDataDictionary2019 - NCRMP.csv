ColumnName,DataType,Size,Units,Description
CTDID,Text,255,,"Unique ID for CTD Cast, if the row is blank this is because there was no unique CTDID given. The water samples were collected from private vessels."
Region,Text,255,,Unique ID for Region
Year,Number,,,4 digit Year
Mission,Text,255,,Cruise ID
Location,Text,255,,3 Letter Unique Location ID
Latitude,Number,,decimal degree,Latitude in decimal degree format
Longitude,Number,,decimal degree,Longitutde in decimal degree format
UTCDate,Date,8,,UTC Date in format MM/DD/YYYY
UTCTime,Time,,,UTC Time in 24 hour time format  HH:MM (:SS optional)
Sample_Depth_m,Number,,meters,Depth sample was taken in meters
DIC,Number,,痠ol/kg,Dissolved Inorganic Carbon-Analysis value measured in micromoles per kilogram
TA,Number,,湲q/kg,Total Alkalinity -Analysis value measured in micromoles per kilogram
pH,Number,,,pH of sample
pCO2,Number,,琦tm,Partial pressure of CO2 in sample
Aragonite_Sat,Number,,,Aragonite saturation state value
Salinity_Bottle,Number,,PSU,Analysis value as Practical Salinity Units
Conductivity_Sm,Number,,Siemens/m,"Value based on water sample evaluation measured in Siemens per meter, left blank because water sample was not collected using a CTD therefore there is no information to report."
Salinity_CTD,Number,,PSU,"Value based on water sample evaluation as Practical Salinity Units, left blank because a majority of these water samples were not collected using a CTD, if salinity is reported it was then given in this column. Salinity measurements for USVI/STT are missing because samples were collected from bottles and salinity calculations for these samples are located in the Salinity_Bottle column."
Temperature_C,Number,,degree C,"Most accurate temperature  value available used to calculate DIC value, measured in degrees Celsius"
Pressure_db,Number,,decibars,"Most accurate Pressure value available used to calculate DIC value, measured in decibars. This column is blank because it is not recorded as part of our collection methods. "
Density_Sigmat,Number,,kg/m3,"Density  value calculated from CTD unit readings in kilogram/cubic meter units, left blank because water sample was not collected using a CTD therefore there is no information to report."
SiteID,Text,10,,"Unique value for site, durived from Climate Station and/or biological Site name if available "
Survey_design,Text,10,,Values are Permanent/Random based on whether this is a permanent site or a random observation
Sample_frequency,Text,10,,Values are Single/Diurnal based on wether this is a single measurement or part of a diurnal series
